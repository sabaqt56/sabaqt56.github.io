                                        These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
                                        I do not knowingly collect personally
                                        identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
                                        I discover that a child under 13 has provided
                                        me with personal information,
                                        I immediately delete this from our servers. If you
                                        are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
                                        has provided us with personal information, please contact
                                        me so that I will be able to do
                                        necessary actions.
